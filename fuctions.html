    <img src="wordsmith.png" >&nbspController
</h2>
<p>
This program controls the Tools. It is the one which shows and alters current defaults, handles the choosing of text files, and calls up the different Tools.
It will appear at the top left corner of your screen.
You can minimise it, if you feel the screen is getting cluttered.

<h2>
    <img src="concordance.png" >&nbspConcord Tool
</h2>
<p>
    Concord is a program which makes a concordance using plain text or web text files.
    To use it you will specify a search word, which Concord will seek in all the text files you have chosen. It will then present a concordance display, and give you access to information about collocates of the search word.
    Listings can be saved for later use, edited, printed, copied to your word-processor, or saved as text files.
</p>
<h2>
    <img src="keywords.png">&nbspKeyWords Tool
</h2>
<p>
    The purpose of this program is to locate and identify key words in a given text. To do so, it compares the words in the text with a reference set of words usually taken from a large corpus of text. Any word which is found to be outstanding in its frequency in the text is considered "key". The key words are presented in order of outstandingness.
    The distribution of the key words can be plotted.
    Listings can be saved for later use, edited, printed, copied to your word-processor, or saved as text files.  
    This program needs access to 2 or more word lists, which must be created first, using the Word List program.
</p>
<h2>
    <img src="wordlist.png" >&nbspWordList Tool
</h2>
<p>
    WordList generates word lists based on one or more plain text or web text files. Word lists are shown both in alphabetical and frequency order. They can be saved for later use, edited, printed, copied to your word-processor, or saved as text files.
</p>

</p>

<h3>
<img src="textconvert.png" >&nbspViewer & Aligner Tool
</h3>
<p>
Text Converter is a general-purpose utility which you use for three main tasks: to edit your texts, to rename text files, to change file attributes, to move files into a new folder if they contain certain words or phrases.
The main use is to replace strings in text files. It does a "search and replace" much as in word-processors, but it can do this on lots of text files, one after the other. As it does so, it can also replace any number of strings, not just one.
It is very useful for going through large numbers of texts and re-formatting them as you prefer, e.g. taking out unnecessary spaces, ensuring only paragraphs have <Enter> at their ends, changing accented characters.
</p>
<h3>
<img src="versioncheck.png" >&nbspViewer & Aligner Tool
</h3>
<p>
A tool to check whether any components of your current version need updating and if so, download them for you. Accessed via the main Controller menu, File | Web version check.
When you run the program you'll see something like this:
</p>
<img src="checking.png" >
<p>The various components of WordSmith are listed in the top window and the current version is compared with your present situation. If they are different, all the files in the relevant zip file will be starred (*) in the left margin.
By default you will download to wherever WordSmith is already (the program in a program folder and settings etc. in a Documents folder) but you're free to choose somewhere else. Press Download if you wish to get the updated files.</p>
<img src="checkingag.jpg" >
<p>
After the download, the various .zip files are checked (bottom right window) if downloaded successfully, and the Install button is now available for use. Install unzips all those which are checked.
